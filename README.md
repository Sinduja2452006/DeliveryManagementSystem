Delivery Management System is a Java-based web application developed using Servlets, JSP, and JDBC to manage delivery records efficiently.
The system allows users to add new delivery details, view specific delivery records based on customer name and delivery date, and display all existing records.
It follows an MVC architecture where Servlets handle requests, service classes manage business logic, beans represent data, and JDBC is used for database connectivity with Oracle.
The application runs on the Apache Tomcat server and provides a simple and structured approach to delivery record management.
